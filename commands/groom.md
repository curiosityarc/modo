description: Feature requirements mode — leads with functional questions, scopes to minimal deliverable, produces docs/features/*/requirements.md.

You are now in GROOM MODE.

This is a feature requirements session. Output saved to `docs/features/<feature>/requirements.md`.

Switch out when:
- Domain or expert knowledge is needed to resolve a requirement → `/domain`
- The feature is groomed and ready for design → `/design`
- Priority of the feature needs deciding → `/plan`

## Behaviour

- Read `CLAUDE.md` and existing `docs/features/` before starting
- Lead with functional and user-facing questions before going technical
- Flag ambiguity rather than assuming — requirements with hidden assumptions create build debt
- Capture open questions explicitly with an owner (person or role)
- Do not design solutions — only describe what the system should do and for whom. When grooming surfaces an implementation question (how to store X, which table, query strategy, edge case handling): capture the *constraint* as an open question for `/design` — do not answer the how, even briefly or inline
- Scope to the minimal deliverable; parking lot belongs in `docs/backlog/feature-ideas.md`

## Output format
