# Agile Board

Create, move, assign, and close tasks on the project's task board.

Reads from:
- `.claude/modo-config.md` → `## Agile Board` section — board type, URLs, label taxonomy, column flow
- `.claude/team.md` — team roster for default assignees and handoffs

## Procedure

### Creating an issue

1. Read `.claude/modo-config.md` to determine board type and column structure
2. Ask which board/project if there are multiple (e.g., Tech vs Ops, Engineering vs Product)
3. Ask issue type to determine labels and starting column (per the config)
4. Read `.claude/team.md` to propose a default assignee based on issue type and role
5. Compose:
   - **Title:** short, imperative, ≤ 72 chars — mirrors commit format
   - **Body:** what + why; link to relevant docs (`docs/features/<feature>/requirements.md`, prior issues, ADRs); for features, include sub-tasks broken down by service
6. Create the issue using the configured CLI (see board type below)
7. Place on board: report the target column; attempt CLI placement if available, otherwise instruct the user to move the card manually

### Moving a card

Read the column flow from config. Common flows:
- **GitHub Projects v2:** `gh project item-edit` is unreliable for column moves — instruct browser drag is faster
- **Linear:** `linear issue update --state <state>`
- **Jira:** `jira issue transition`

### Closing on ship

When a task ships:
1. Close the issue with a brief comment: what was done, date, any follow-up items created
2. Use `closes #N` in the final commit (via `/git`), not here
3. **Unblock dependents:** search for any open issues that list this issue as a blocker (search for `#N`, `blocks`, or `blocked by` in open issue bodies and comments). For each one found:
   - Remove or update the blocking reference in the issue body
   - If the issue was in a "Blocked" column or had a "blocked" label, move it to the appropriate ready/backlog column and remove the label
   - Leave a comment on the unblocked issue noting that the blocker (`#N`) has shipped and it can proceed

### Handoffs and assignments

Read `.claude/team.md` for handles. Never hardcode handles in this skill — always look them up at runtime.
If a role-based assignment is requested ("assign to the mobile lead"), look up the team member in that role.

## Board-type CLI

Determined by `## Agile Board → type` in `.claude/modo-config.md`:

**GitHub Issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo <owner>/<repo> \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "<body>" \
  --label "<labels>" \
  --assignee "<handle>"
```

**Linear:**
```bash
linear issue create --title "<title>" --description "<body>" --team <team-id> --assignee <user-id>
```

**Jira:**
```bash
jira issue create --project <key> --summary "<title>" --description "<body>" --assignee <user-id>
```

## Conventions (always apply)

- `refs #N` in commits during development; `closes #N` in the final shipping commit only
- One feature = one issue; sub-tasks go in the body unless they ship independently
- Do not close issues autonomously without confirming with the user
